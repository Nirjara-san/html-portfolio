<h3>Obstacle avoiding vehicle</h3>
<p>
    Designed and built an obstacle-avoiding car using Arduino, integrating ultrasonic sensors for real-time obstacle detection and avoidance. Programmed the microcontroller to process sensor inputs and control motor movements, ensuring efficient and autonomous navigation. The project involved designing the circuit, writing optimized C++ code for Arduino, and testing various scenarios to ensure smooth operation. It showcases my skills in hardware-software integration, embedded systems programming, circuit design, and problem-solving in robotics. This hands-on experience deepened my understanding of IoT and embedded technology
